"""Tests for press_monitor's pure functions. Standalone, no network.

feedparser is stubbed below because it is absent from a plain working copy.
That is safe ONLY because feedparser is touched solely by parse_feed, which
none of the functions tested here calls. If a test ever needs a
feed-parsing function, REMOVE THE STUB rather than extending it: a stub
that grows is a stub that starts hiding things.

THE ONE THAT MATTERS: prefix matching does not bridge a form-type rename.
The SEC renamed SC 13D to SCHEDULE 13D and 117 filings went unposted,
because "SCHEDULE 13D".startswith("SC 13D") is False and nothing said so.
drift_candidates exists to catch the next rename, and the checks below are
what stop it quietly ceasing to.
